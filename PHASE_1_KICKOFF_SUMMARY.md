**Date**: Oct 22, 2025, 11:49 AM UTC+01:00
**Status**: ✅ **PHASE 1 OFFICIALLY GREEN-LIT** 🚀
**Timeline**: Start live dry-run this week
**Owner**: Dev
**Next Sync**: End of Week 1 (Oct 25, 2025)

## Executive Summary

Terry has reviewed the implementation analysis and officially approved Phase 1 + Phase 2. All alignment is confirmed. **Dev is cleared to start the 5-day live dry-run this week.**

---

## ✅ What's Confirmed

### Phase 1: Live Dry-Run (Real MT5 Data)
- ✅ Use live MT5 feed (not mock)
- ✅ Execution mode = dry-run (no live orders)
- ✅ Expected: 0 validation errors, pass-rate 5-15%, RR ≥1.5 for 100%
- ✅ Timeline: 5 trading days (this week)

### Phase 2: Structure-First SL/TP
- ✅ OB + FVG first (Week 2)
- ✅ ATR fallback as safety net
- ✅ 95% structure-exit goal
- ✅ RR ≥1.5 rejection rule (reject if post-clamp RR < 1.5)
- ✅ Expand to Engulf/UZR/Sweep in Week 3

### Phase 3 & 4
- ✅ Profit protection: design only (no code until Phase 2 passes)
- ✅ Paper → live ramp: stays as-is (week 6+)

## 🎯 Dev Action Items (This Week)

### Priority 1: Confirm MT5 Data Source
- [ ] Which broker/server are you using?
- [ ] Is it demo or live account?
- [ ] Verify connection is active and stable

### Priority 2: Verify Data Stability
- [ ] Fetch 1000 M15 bars for EURUSD
- [ ] Check: 0 gaps, 0 duplicates, valid OHLC relationships
- [ ] Run `test_data_quality.py` to validate
- [ ] **Expected**: 1000 consecutive 15-minute candles

### Priority 3: Start 5-Day Live Dry-Run
- [ ] Keep `execution.mode = "dry-run"` (no live orders)
- [ ] Monitor daily: pass-rate, RR compliance, validation errors
- [ ] Collect all logs (gate_eval, decision, dry_run_summary, hourly_summary)
- [ ] **Expected**: 0 validation errors across 5 days

### Priority 4: Collect Determinism Replay Results
- [ ] Run `test_determinism.py` (100 bars, 100% match expected)
- [ ] Generate diff output (decision-by-decision comparison)
- [ ] Share results with Terry

### Priority 5: Prepare Phase 1 Summary (End of Week)
- [ ] 5-day dry-run results
- [ ] Data quality validation report
- [ ] Determinism replay results
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Phase 2?

   - Total decisions generated
   - Total validation failures (expected: 0)

3. **Determinism Replay Results**
   - 100 bars → 100% match on replay
   - Diff output (decision-by-decision comparison)

4. **Data Quality Report**
   - Bars processed: 1000
   - Gaps detected: 0
   - Duplicates detected: 0
   - OHLC validity: 100%

5. **Phase 2 Readiness**
   - Are we ready to proceed to Phase 2?
   - Any issues or concerns?

## 🚀 Phase 2 Implementation (Locked)

### OB + FVG Exits (Week 2)

**SL/TP Calculation**:
- OB: SL just beyond zone edge ± sl_atr_buffer; TP to opposite edge
- FVG: SL beyond nearer gap edge ± buffer; TP to far edge

**Broker Clamp + RR Re-Check**:
- After calculating structure SL/TP, clamp to broker limits
- Re-check RR after clamp
- **If RR < 1.5, reject trade** (don't degrade silently)

**Logging**:
- Log exit_reason: "structure" | "structure+atr_buffer" | "atr_fallback"
- Target: ≥95% "structure" exits

**Feature Flag** (configs/structure.json):
```json
{
  "sltp_planning": {
    "use_structure_exits": false,  // Phase 1: false
    "structure_exit_types": ["order_block", "fair_value_gap"],
    "atr_fallback_enabled": true,
    "sl_atr_buffer": 0.5,
    "tp_extension_atr": 1.0
  }
}
```

### Phase 2 Week 1 → Week 2 Transition
- Week 1: use_structure_exits = false (ATR-only exits)
- Week 2: use_structure_exits = true, types = [OB, FVG]
- Week 3: expand types = [OB, FVG, Engulfing, UZR, Sweep]

## 📅 Timeline (Confirmed)

| Week | Phase | Tasks | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 (Now) | Phase 1 | Live dry-run (5 days) | 🟢 GO |
| 2 | Phase 2a | OB+FVG exits (3 days) | 🟡 Next |
| 3 | Phase 2b | Expand to Engulf/UZR/Sweep (3 days) | 🟡 Next |
| 4-5 | Phase 3 | Profit protection + recovery (design + code) | 🟡 After Phase 2 |
| 6-7+ | Phase 4 | Paper → live ramp (2 weeks) | 🟡 After Phase 3 |

---

## 🔑 Key Decisions (Locked)

1. **Use MT5 live feed** (not mock) for Phase 1
2. **All timestamps UTC** (convert broker time on ingestion)
3. **Reject trades post-clamp** if RR < 1.5 (don't degrade silently)
4. **Phase 2 Week 1**: OB+FVG only, then expand Week 2
5. **Target 0 validation errors** (investigate any failures immediately)
6. **Phase 3 design only** until Phase 2 passes (no code changes)

**Status**: ✅ **PHASE 1 OFFICIALLY GREEN-LIT** 🚀

**Dev**: Start the 5-day live dry-run this week. Confirm MT5 data source and verify data stability first.

**Terry**: Sync with Dev at end of week for Phase 1 results and Phase 2 readiness check.
