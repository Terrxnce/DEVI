**Date**: Oct 22, 2025, 12:34 PM UTC+01:00
**Status**: ✅ ALL 3 ARTIFACTS UPLOADED & READY FOR VALIDATION

## 📦 Artifacts Created

### 1. MT5 Source Confirmation ✅

**Size**: 1,146 bytes
**Status**: Ready for validation

**Key Fields**:
- `mock`: true
- `source`: "synthetic"
- `broker`: "ICMarkets-Demo"
- `connection_status`: "simulated"
- `phase`: "Phase 1 - Pipeline Validation (Synthetic Data)"
- `note`: "Real MT5 integration will occur in Phase 1.5"

**Verification**:
- ✅ All configs loaded without errors
- ✅ All detectors initialized
- ✅ Composite scorer instantiated
- ✅ Executor registered (dry-run mode)
- ✅ Logging configured (JSON format)
- ✅ Deterministic mode enabled (seed: 42)

## ✅ Validation Checklist

- [x] `artifacts/` folder created
- [x] `mt5_source_confirmation.json` uploaded (mock: true, source: synthetic)
- [x] `data_quality_EURUSD.json` uploaded (1000 bars, 0 gaps/dupes, UTC)
- [x] `config_fingerprint.txt` uploaded (SHA256 hashes verified)
- [x] All 3 artifacts marked as synthetic/mock
- [x] All timestamps in UTC
- [x] Deterministic mode enabled (seed: 42)
- [x] Execution mode: dry-run
- [x] Ready for dry-run loop

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Immediate** (Once you validate):
1. ✅ You review the 3 artifacts
2. ✅ You approve the synthetic data approach
3. ✅ I start the 5-day dry-run loop

**During Dry-Run** (Oct 22-25):
- Collect logs daily: `gate_eval.jsonl`, `decision.jsonl`, `hourly_summary.jsonl`, `dry_run_summary.jsonl`
- Generate daily summary: `artifacts/daily_summary_DAY_N.json`
- Monitor: pass-rate, RR compliance, validation errors
- Flag blockers immediately (don't wait for EOD)

**End of Week** (Oct 25):
- Generate determinism diff: `artifacts/determinism_diff.txt` (100-bar replay)
- Compile Phase 1 summary
- Validate all success criteria
- Ready for Phase 1.5 (MT5 Integration)

---

## 📋 Success Criteria (Phase 1)

- ✅ 0 validation errors across 5 days
- ✅ Pass-rate 5-15% (noise filter healthy)
- ✅ RR compliance 100% (all ≥1.5)
- ✅ Determinism verified (100% match on 100-bar replay)
- ✅ All logs collected (4 file types daily)
- ✅ Config fingerprint captured
- ✅ Ready for Phase 1.5

---

## 📝 Phase 1.5 Roadmap (After Phase 1 Passes)

Once Phase 1 passes with synthetic data:
1. Implement real MT5 connection module
2. Create data loader for live MT5 feed
3. Update `mt5_source_confirmation.json` (mock: false, source: mt5_live)
4. Run Phase 1.5 validation with real data
5. Verify determinism still holds
6. Approve Phase 2 (OB+FVG structure exits)

---

## ✅ Status

**Artifacts**: ✅ READY
**Validation**: Awaiting your review
**Dry-Run**: Ready to start once you approve
**Timeline**: EOD today for confirmations, 5-day dry-run starts immediately after approval

---

**Cascade (Lead Developer)**
**Ready to proceed with dry-run once you validate the 3 artifacts.**
