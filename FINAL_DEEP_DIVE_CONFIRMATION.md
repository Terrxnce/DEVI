## Bug Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: EngulfingDetector Not Inheriting ✅
**Problem**: EngulfingDetector was a standalone class, not inheriting from StructureDetector
**Fix**: Changed to `class EngulfingDetector(StructureDetector):`
**Status**: FIXED & VERIFIED

### Issue 2: EngulfingDetector Missing name Attribute ✅
**Problem**: EngulfingDetector didn't have `name` attribute (inherited from base class)
**Fix**: Added `super().__init__('EngulfingDetector', StructureType.ENGULFING, config)`
**Status**: FIXED & VERIFIED

### Issue 3: EngulfingDetector Using Wrong ID Method ✅
**Problem**: EngulfingDetector had `_generate_id()` method that didn't exist
**Fix**: Changed to use base class `_create_structure()` helper method
**Status**: FIXED & VERIFIED

### Issue 4: Decimal/Float Multiplication Errors ✅
**Problem**: Multiplying Decimal by float config values caused TypeError
**Fix**: Converted float config to Decimal: `Decimal(str(float(self.min_body_atr))) * atr`
**Status**: FIXED in all detectors

### Issue 5: ExecutionResult Missing Fields ✅
**Problem**: ExecutionResult missing `rr` and `validation_errors` fields
**Fix**: Added both fields to dataclass
**Status**: FIXED & VERIFIED
